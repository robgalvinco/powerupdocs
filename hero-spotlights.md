## [This Hero is a Short and Sweet Winner](https://www.spillpiano.com/courses/thewinner)

* Love how he is using colors to make the sidebar "pop" and also the "what you will learn" section
* The course card image is spot on in communicating what the course is about
* The video is awesome in that I am drawn into seeing exactly how he will be teaching me to learn how to play the piano. And this is much better than having to sign up for a "free lesson"
* I can't find much more to recommend to change for this page besides maybe moving the sticky position down a bit with the [setting we have for this](snap-course-page-templates/snap-design-templates/snap-course-page-01.md#sidebar)\

* Ian Richardson, a fellow Thinkific Expert uses our PowerUps to not only to improve his site, but his clients as well
* I really like how he is using a link in the CTA section to also try and attract group sales (he could also use the secondary CTA for this
* Nice use of clean colors and "just enough information" on the page. Nice job on bolding the What You'll Learn bullet lists

* Love the use of colors in the site to make the sidebar pop
* Daniel is also using the Sale feature which will certainly help with conversions
* Also love that Daniel choose to use a video on this page. Video helps with conversions
