# Uninstalling

Please tell me it's not true - say it ain't so. **Do you really want to remove this super power** from your site? You realize you will lose all of that super power strength â€‹ðŸ¦¸ that you once had, don't you?â€Œ

Ok, well if you really really want to, the instructions are below â€‹ðŸ‘‡

## â€‹â€‹ðŸ¦¹ Here is how to lose your super powersðŸ‘‡â€Œ <a href="#here-is-how-to-lose-your-super-powers" id="here-is-how-to-lose-your-super-powers"></a>

Head over to your apps page inside of your site

* Locate **Swiss** :boom: **PowerUp** and click the _nasty red rash can button to uninstall the app_

One more warning here - if you uninstall Swiss, you will not be able to reinstall it on another site unless you have purchased the [PowerUps Agency license](https://powerups.thinkific.com/pages/playeah#pricing)â€‹â€Œ
