Please tell me it's not true - say it ain't so. **Do you really want to remove this super power** from your site? You realize you will lose all of that super power strength â€‹ðŸ¦¸ that you once had, don't you?â€Œ

Ok, well if you really really want to, the instructions are below â€‹ðŸ‘‡

## â€‹â€‹ðŸ¦¹ Here is how to lose your super powersðŸ‘‡â€Œ <a href="#here-is-how-to-lose-your-super-powers" id="here-is-how-to-lose-your-super-powers"></a>

Head over to your apps page inside of your site

* Locate the :boom: **PowerUp** and click the _nasty red trash can button to uninstall the app_
