### It is as simple as adding your time codes to the text portion of your video lessons and underlining them.&#x20;

* [ ] Edit a video lesson inside your Curriculum tab for your course
* [ ] Inside the optional Text settings below the video, enter your SmartText Timecode links in a **HH:MM:SS** or **MM:SS** format anywhere in the text either in a bullet list or even within the paragraph or headings.&#x20;
* [ ] Highlight just the time portion of the individual time codes and **select the underline tool   `U`**&#x20;
* [ ] Preview the lesson as a student and click on the links to see the video change to the time you specified
