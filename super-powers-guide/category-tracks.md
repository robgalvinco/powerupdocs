# Category Tracks

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must first create a [Product index](product-index.md) to use the Category Tracks section.&#x20;

**NEW:** This is now supported on any page. When used on a page that is not the student dashboard (ex: Home, All Courses, Custom), you still need to provide a product index snippet and the course cards will always link to the course landing page. Keep in mind the product index will need to be update on all pages, when there is a change to your product catalog.
