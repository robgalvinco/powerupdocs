# Auto Resume / Suggest

This section provides a way for your students to "keep consuming" because they literally have to log in and click a button to keep watching.&#x20;

### Zero Enrollments:

This group of settings allows you to control what happens when the student is not enrolled in any courses.

* **How to handle zero enrollments**
  * _Show message:_ This will show a custom message. Use the content settings below:
    * Heading: changes the heading of the section when the student is not enrolled in any courses
    * Summary text: changes the summary text when the student is not enrolled in any courses
    * Button Text: sets the text of the button when the student is not enrolled in any courses
    * Button Page: sets the url for the button to be used when the student is not enrolled in any courses
  * _Redirect_: This will redirect  the student to another page when they are not enrolled in any courses
    * Redirect Page: Set this to a page where you would like the student to be redirected to (ex: "Your subscription has expired, upgrade now" page)

* **Resume Heading**: this is the text that appears on top of the section. It supports **SmartText** for personalization. ex: Welcome \[NAME], here is the next recommended course for you
*   **What to show**: This determins what course to show:

    * _Last Accessed:_ This will show the course they were last watching (determined by Thinkific algorithm)
    * _Next Not Completed: ****_ This will show the next course from a bundle specified in the "Blocks". This allows you to create a specific learning path for them to consume in a specific order. When choosing this setting be sure to add a bundle in the Block Settings.



#### Block Settings:

When using the _Next Not Completed option for "What to show"_  you must specify a bundle to be used for the auto suggestion. The suggested course will be the "next one not completed". You can add several bundles and it will go in succession.

{% hint style="info" %}
While in Site Builder, you will not see the "Next Not Completed" course because Site Builder does not have any context of "logged in user". However, the _next not completed_ course will show up in the actual student dashboard page.
{% endhint %}

### Style Settings:

* **Type:** This will determine how this section looks
  * _Small (Default):_ This will show a small thumbnail of the course image, along with the course name and description.
  * _Large:_ This will show a large background blurred out course image with a color gradient (similar to a "Netflix style"). You may want to increase your course card image from the standard recommended size in order for this to look properly
* **Large resume background (color):** This controls the overlay color that  is used in the _Large type._
* **Overlay Type:** this controls the style of the overlay - Choose from two gradient variations or a solid color
* **Large Resume Text (color)**: This is the color of the text when used in the _Large type_
* **Blur Effect**: this is a slider that allows you to control the blur effect of the image to create a "subtle" background.
