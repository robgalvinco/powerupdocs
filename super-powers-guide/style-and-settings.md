# Style & Settings

Now that you have your new Flix student dashboard experience set up, it's time to change the style so that it matches your brand colors.

### Use a prebuilt style:  (aka the instant style method)

We have included several prebuilt styles to allow you to quickly choose a good color combination. You can simply select one and run with it as is, or take one and adjust the colors to suite your needs.
