# Product index

{% hint style="danger" %}
This section is required for the Category Tracks section to work and also needs to only be added to a **Custom Page.** Do not add this to any other page that will be visible to students or website visitors.
{% endhint %}

### How to use the Product index section

* [ ] Create a **Custom page** (remove the banner and set the permissions so only you can see it)
* [ ] Add the `Product index` section to the page
* [ ] After a few moments you will see the product index generated.
* [ ] Click the Copy to Clipboard button and paste the product index snippet into the [Category Tracks](category-tracks.md) section on the student dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
You must regenerate and copy/paste a new product index snippet each time you:

* Add or remove courses
* Add or remove categories
* Change what categories courses belong in
{% endhint %}
