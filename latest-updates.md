Are you using the "[secret Loom superpower](frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-use-the-loom-video-feature)" inside of SNAP Course Page Templates?\
With all of the recent video problems Thinkific is having lately, now is a good time to start using it.Why you ask?We love Loom because it has built in reactions and comments right inside the video player.This helps with conversions because people can see other reactions and it is like automatic social proof that you do not need to spend any time on. They can also comment in the video as wellHow do you use it?\
