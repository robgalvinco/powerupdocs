# Best Practices

Don't you hate it when you walk into a store :shopping\_bags: and someone immediately walks up to you and asks you if you need any help :unamused: . Then they ask you again in another 30 seconds, and then again in another 4 minutes? _Ok, maybe that is a bit exaggerated, but if it was really like that wouldn't it be_ Quite annoying????

**That is not what we want to be like with PowerPops** ðŸ‘†.

**What we do to be is**:

* **Encouraging**, _but not intrusive your annoying neighbor who can't mind their biz-ness_
* **Remindful,** _but not like a firehose telling you to water your plants_&#x20;
* **Fun**, _but not offensive or rude like a 1980's stand up comic_
* **Celebratory,** but not like your drunk uncle at your cousins wedding
* **Nudgy,** _but not be the pushy push you over the cliff pushy_

_****_:wink: _**You get my drift plaYEAH!?**_ :point\_up\_2:&#x20;
