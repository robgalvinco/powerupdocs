**WARNING!** Do not put the Power Pops sections on the same page that you  are using for [Tour Guide](../../tour-guide/using-the-course-player-tour.md#how-to-use-the-tour-guide) or [Power Styles](../../power-style-editor/power-style-quick-start-guide/). It needs to be set up on it's own custom page.
