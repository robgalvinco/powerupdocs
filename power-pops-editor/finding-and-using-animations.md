# Finding & Using Animations

Ok plaYEAH!, you[ just conquered the basics](../instant-super-powers/quick-wins.md#start-powerpoppin) of your first PowerPop flow. Now let me show you how to [use a massive free library](https://lottiefiles.com/) of open source animations at your disposal - we are talking by the thousands my friend ðŸ˜²

### Introducing Lottiefiles

In the previous quick wins, you may have noticed a setting we called **Lottie JSON url** (or maybe you were too excited by the **awesome super powers** :man\_superhero: **plaYEAH!** is going to give you). Lottie is an open source animation file format thatâ€™s tiny, high quality, interactive and **the perfect solution** to use inside your course to **jazz things up a bit to make** it a lot more **interesting** and **engaging** _(unless you are in the .02% that think dull boring lifeless grey is exciting)_ . This is the new industry standard that is available on the web, on your phone and on your toaster :bread: (if you have a "smart toaster" that is). The top 500 apps on the App store now use Lottie to engage users and enhance conversions.&#x20;

## Lottiefiles is the largest community of designers and developers. Essentially an extensive, curated library of free assets awaits you.

What we have included in the [Favorites Animations page](https://powerups.thinkific.com/pages/playeah-power-pop-favs) is just a teeny-incy-weeny-tiny sample if what is available that **we spent years curating**...._just kidding it was only a few hours_...but a few hours you did not have to ~~waste~~ spend...and still has over 100 animations in it...but.... anywhoo



This **massive library contains both free and really really cheap** (_less than you would pay for a fresh brewed cup of_:coffee:_)_ animations. In fact, they even have a [page where you can hire animators](https://lottiefiles.com/marketplace/animators) (aka "Lottie Experts" - if you really want to go crazy and have a custom animation built for you (or for a client that is willing to pay you to pay some to creating something for them - :zany\_face: )

Now, with any "free market" there is always a chance that you will see :poop: on there. But because you are a plaYEAH!, we got you covered and will give you some pro tips for navigating Lottiefiles. Here are some awesome ways to find stuff:

:mag\_right: **Keyword search** is always a good idea

:mag\_right: Search by **specific color**

:mag\_right: Turn on the "**free filter**"

:mag\_right: Consider purchasing a **"pack" of similar animations**
