### Getting Started&#x20;

* [ ] Log into the [SuperPowerUps.com member portal](https://www.superpowerups.com) and activate MegaNav from [the activation page](https://www.superpowerups.com/pages/meganav-install)
* [ ] Enter your Thinkific subdomain to access the [MegaNav Menu Builder](https://www.superpowerups.com/pages/meganav-menu-builder)
* [ ] Use the MegaNav Menu Builder to create a bullet list of links or menus and links
  * **Simple links:**Add your text and then highlight the text and add a link
  * **Simple menus:**Add your text for the menu and then indent one level and add your links
  * **Sub Menus:**Within a simple menu indent one level and create another simple menu with a label and sub links below it
  * **Sub Columns:**Create a label at the top level and add the text **\[COLS]** to it. Then each item below it must be a submenu (up to 5). You cannot put simple links below a Sub Column menu
* [ ] Click the Publish button when ready
* [ ] Paste the code snippet provided into one of your current Header links in the Text Field

### Important MegaNav Usage Notes

* Your bullet list must be "continuous". You should not include any blank lines between bullets
* You should not create anything more than "3 levels" deep
* Your logo will automatically be inserted into the MegaNav. The sizing of your logo will be automatic
* Your current Site Builder Header section will be replaced by the MegaNav. No settings will be used after the MegaNav is installed
* The MegaNav is purposely intended always be a sticky menu (remember our goal is to make your links quickly and easily accessible)
* Your color scheme will also typically be reused, but in some cases you may want to adjust it with the MegaNav custom color option
