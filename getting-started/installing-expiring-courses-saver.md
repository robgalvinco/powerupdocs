# Installing Expiring Courses Saver

### Before Installation:  Create an account and purchase Ding

Expiring Courses Saver **does not require a monthly subscription.** We do however require you to create an account on [SuperPowerUps.com ](https://www.superpowerups.com/)and purchase Expiring Courses Saver before you can install it into any site. If you are a [PowerUp Pass member](https://www.superpowerups.com/cart/add\_product/1596829?price\_id=2254107), then you will have instant access to Expiring Courses Saver without having to purchase it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After your purchase you will be able to install the Expiring Courses Saver app from the [member portal](https://powerups.thinkific.com/pages/playeah-activation).  Depending on the license that was purchased, you may be able to install this app on many Thinkific sites or just one site.

During the **purchase process you will already be directed to this page automatically after purchase**. You should also be already logged in to the member portal at this time, but in case you need to revisit the page, or if you were rudely interrupted :triumph: during the process, you can restart the process by just logging back into the [member portal](https://powerups.thinkific.com/enrollments).
{% endhint %}

### STEP 3: Accept the App Installation

After entering your subdomain, you will see a screen that looks like below. Be sure to click on the **ACCEPT & INSTALL** button. :point\_down: It's that big dark blue-ish / purple-ish button at the bottom of the page

{% hint style="warning" %}
Expiring Courses Saver does not actually use any API's or access any of your Thinkific site data. Currently Thinkific's app screen that you see above is the same for all applications. The clause noted "Access and modify your Thinkific data" is applied to all Apps by Thinkific, however Expiring Courses Saver does not use any such requests.&#x20;
