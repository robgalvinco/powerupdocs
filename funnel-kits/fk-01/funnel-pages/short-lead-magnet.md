# Short Lead Magnet

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Site-Builder-Thinkific - 2022-04-30T105328.599.png>)

Use the follow sections to build this page:

* [ ] [FK 01 - Activation Settings](../sections/fk-01-activation-and-settings.md): This is required for all FK 01 pages. It is recommended to keep the default Thinkific Header and Footer links hidden
* [ ] [FK 01 - Banner](../sections/fk-01-banner.md): This section has options to use the built in Thinkific lead capture form, a custom form that you can use from your email marketing platform, or can be a button that can be linked to enroll in a course.
* [ ] [FK 01 - List](../sections/fk-01-list.md) (optional): A short bullet list is a great way to "sum up the key benefits" for your audience to drive a quick decision on opt-in into your lead magnet.
* [ ] [FK 01 - About Me](../sections/fk-01-about-me.md) (optional): This section will help your audience get to know you
