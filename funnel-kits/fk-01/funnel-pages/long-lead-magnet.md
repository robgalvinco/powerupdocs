![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Site-Builder-Thinkific - 2022-04-30T105626.031.png>)

Use the follow sections to build this page:

* [ ] [FK 01 - Activation Settings](../sections/fk-01-activation-and-settings.md): This is required for all FK 01 pages. It is recommended to keep the default Thinkific Header and Footer links hidden
* [ ] [FK 01 - Page Nav](../sections/fk-01-page-nav.md): Since we will have a longer page, we want to always keep the call to action front and center as well as allow the user to quick jump to key sections using the in page navigation
* [ ] [FK 01 - Banner](../sections/fk-01-banner.md): This section has options to use the built in Thinkific lead capture form, a custom form that you can use from your email marketing platform, or can be a button that can be linked to enroll in a course.
* [ ] [FK 01 - List](../sections/fk-01-list.md): In this section we want to have a quick scannable list of either what is included in the freebie
* [ ] [FK 01 - Testimonials](../sections/fk-01-testimonials.md): This section is to show the website visitor that it "is worth their time" by showing a few quotes from previous users. And if you don't have any quotes, then you can choose to omit this section
* [ ] [FK 01 About me](../sections/fk-01-about-me.md): This section gives the website visitor a brief summary of who you or your company is. This may be the first time they are encountering you and want to see you are semi-legit
* [ ] [FK 01 Featured In Icons:](../sections/fk-01-featured-in-icons.md) This section allows you to show some recognizable icons of publications, websites, podcasts, media shows you may have been on or mentioned in.
* [ ] [FK 01 Call to Action](../sections/fk-01-call-to-action.md): We always want to place a call to action towards the end of teh page for people who either read everything or just jump to the bottom of the page
* [ ] [FK 01 FAQ with CTA](../sections/fk-01-faq-with-cta.md): People always have questions - might as well answer common questions on the page to either reconfirm key benefits or bust the major/typical objections.&#x20;
