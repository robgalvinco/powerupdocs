# Funnel Pages

Here are some Funnel Pages that are recommended to be used as part of your Funnel:

* ****[**Short Lead Magnet**](short-lead-magnet.md) - This page is easy to put together and should contain "short and sweet' information that keeps your audience focused on what they are signing up for.
* ****[**Long Lead Magnet**](long-lead-magnet.md) - This funnel is similar to the Simple Lead Capture Funnel - but contains a longer form lead magnet page. You may want to consider a long form lead magnet page if the lead magnet needs more explanation and convincing.
* ****[**Thank You** ](thank-you.md)**-** This page will deliver the lead magnet and also look to get them to consume more content.
