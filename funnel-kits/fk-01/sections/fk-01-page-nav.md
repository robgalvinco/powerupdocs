![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-03-20 at 3.53.19 PM.png>)

This section is intended to be used on a longer form page and would include links in the navigation that scrolls the page down to key sections. When you add this section to the page, it will automatically look for Funnel Kit sections that have their FK Page Nav option enabled:

### Adding links to the Page Nav

* [ ] Add Funnel Kit sections to the page
* [ ] Inside of the section settings, configure the FK Page Nav options:

* **Add this section?** - this option will enable the section to be linked from the FK Page Nav
* **Is this the main CTA? -** this will cause this section to be linked to button that is on the page nav. Be sure there is only one of these
* **Label** - this is the text that is used in either the link or the button

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding this section will automatically hide the default Thinkific header&#x20;
{% endhint %}
