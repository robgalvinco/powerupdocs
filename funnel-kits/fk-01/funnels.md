# Funnels

Below are some example funnels you can build using this Funnel Kit. Each Funnel consists of multiple pages that you will create. Each page will contain the recommended sections to be used on that page.

## #1 Simple Lead Capture

This funnel is perfect for capturing leads and building an audience prior to selling your course or membership. When your goal is to capture a lead, you want it to be as a frictionless experience as possible and deliver easy to consume and digest content. The goal here is to give your audience some "quick wins" so that they want more from you.

There are two pages in this funnel

* [Short Lead Magnet](funnel-pages/short-lead-magnet.md): This page is easy to put together and should contain "short and sweet' information that keeps your audience focused on what they are signing up for.
* [Thank You Page](funnel-pages/thank-you.md): This page will deliver the lead magnet and also look to get them to consume more content.

#### Create these pages to build this funnel:

{% content-ref url="funnel-pages/short-lead-magnet.md" %}
[short-lead-magnet.md](funnel-pages/short-lead-magnet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="funnel-pages/thank-you.md" %}
[thank-you.md](funnel-pages/thank-you.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## #2 Long Form Lead Capture

This funnel is similar to the Simple Lead Capture Funnel - but contains a longer form lead magnet page. You may want to consider a long form lead magnet page if the lead magnet needs more explanation and convincing.

#### Create these pages to build this funnel:

{% content-ref url="funnel-pages/long-lead-magnet.md" %}
[long-lead-magnet.md](funnel-pages/long-lead-magnet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="funnel-pages/thank-you.md" %}
[thank-you.md](funnel-pages/thank-you.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
