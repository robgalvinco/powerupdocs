# ðŸ¤” FAQ's

## Why would I want to use Player Snips?

When you are using any text options inside your course curriculum and you want an easier way to make it look better. We have created a library of copy and paste fill-in-the-blank design snippets for you to use.

You can also add some fun effects like confetti, emojis or even sound effects when lessons are started or completed

Personalized Popups can be configured to automatically show when specific lessons are started or completed. They can play a sound on entry and also auto close after a confugured amount of time. Popups can also be clickable to an external page when a call to action is required.

## What are some use case examples?

* Callouts to bring attention to important things like "what you will learn in this lesson"&#x20;
* Banners and calls to action that can be used for various reasons
* Richer formatting of lists of downloads or resources
* Image galleries
* Complete text lessons with richly designed layouts
* Quick responsive layout options&#x20;
* Change the lessons formatting quickly ex: expanding the default width of the content area

## Do I need to be technical to use this?

No, although your eyes will see "code", you do not have to be technical to use this. You will be using the built in Site Builder to create your player snips without having to modify any code. Then you will simply copy and paste the Player Snip into your course lessons. Each PlayerSnip comes with step by step instructions for the specific details that may be associated with the Player Snip. We also feel that this process is waaaaay less frustrating than using the standard editor that you have been using.

## Can the Player Snips be combined?

Yes, you can stack any combination of Player Snips to create the perfect design you are looking to achieve. We really love stacking content snips with effects and popups.

## How many Player Snips are available to use?

The library of Player Snips initially became available with over 30 Player Snips. We will regularly being adding new Player Snips and capabilities. As long you have access to Player Snips, you will have access to any Player Snip we release.

## How easy is it to change the placeholder info?

The placeholders are easy to replace. All editing is done inside of Site Builder just like how you would edit a page. You will not have to touch any code. All code that is used inside the course lesson is automatically generated for you. After using Site Builder, you will then simply copy and paste into your course lesson.

## What if I want to change a lesson that is "live" to students?

What we recommend is that you create a new lesson in "draft" mode until you have it completed. Then you can switch the new lesson to live mode and either the delete the older version of the lesson or put that one in draft mode

## Are the Player Snips "responsive"? Do they look good on mobile?

Yes, all of the Player Snips are automatically mobile friendly and will adapt to various display sizes. There is nothing for you to do here.

## What colors are used?

In Player Snips that have buttons, checklists, icons and accent colors, we automatically use the "brand" color that you have set for the course. It will be the same coloring that is used for the Complete and Continue button. In some cases we use multiple accent colors and the secondary accent colors use an opacity level or your main color (which lightens your colors on a white background and darkens your color on a dark mode player).

If you would like to change the color scheme used, you can change the color mode for that Player Snip and fully customize the perfect color combination.

## Does this work with both Light and Dark Course player themes?

Yes, Player Snips works with both Light and Dark mode course player themes
