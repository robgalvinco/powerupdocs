# Uninstalling plaYEAH!

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/d2lcHJTG5Tscg/giphy.gif)

ðŸ˜¢  plaYEAH! - please tell me it's not true - say it ain't so. **Do you really want to remove plaYEAH!** from your site? You realize you will lose all of that super power strength :man\_superhero: that you once had, don't you?

Ok, well if you really really want to, the instructions are below :point\_down:&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important Note:** once you uninstall plaYEAH! - you will no longer be able to create Power Pops that will help encourage, entertain, engage and motivate your students to completing your course. **You will also**, not be able to create or update any new Power Styles for your course player.&#x20;

I just want you to understand the consequences before making such terrible decision... but because I still love ya - as long as you keep your plaYEAH scripts inside your site footer code settings - you will still get _to use the last Power Style and Power Pop_ you pasted there. Just don't remove it
{% endhint %}

## :woman\_supervillain: Here is how to lose your super powersðŸ‘‡

* [ ] Head over to your integrations page inside of your site&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
One more warning here - if you uninstall plaYEAH, you will not be able to reinstall it on another site unless you have purchased the[ PowerUps Agency license](https://powerups.thinkific.com/pages/playeah#pricing)
{% endhint %}

* [ ] Next, put your hand under your chin and look to the sky and really, really think hard for a few minutes about the next button you click. _To regain your super powers you are about to lose_, **click the No, Keep It button** - or if you really want to go back to "joe basic course creator dude", then _click the Yes, Uninstall_ button
