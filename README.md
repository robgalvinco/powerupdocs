# ðŸ’¥ Getting Started With Player Snips

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will not see how the player looks from the curriculum preview page. You must view the snippet from the course player. If you are adding or changing existing lessons on a live course, you may want to keep the lesson in draft mode until you are happy with all of your changes and then turn off draft mode to make the lesson available to your students

* [ ] Go into the individual **Player Snip section settings** and change the options based on your preferences. Each Player Snip will come with a different set of configuration options.
