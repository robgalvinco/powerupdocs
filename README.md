# ðŸš€ Getting Started With SmartText

### Why You Should Use SmartText

There are two primary reasons why you should be using SmartText:

1. **Increase your sales with personalized site pages using SmartTags and SmartLinks**: By using SmartText tags within your site pages, you can have your page speak directly to your reader by injecting personalized attributes like their name, company, type of user and more. Using SmartLinks, you can also deliver different variations of your sales page copy so that the messaging is better directed at the website visitor. Works perfectly with any email marketing platform as well as sharing links via social media.
2. **Improve your video lesson experience with SmartTimeCodes:** Give your students a better idea of what is included in your videos with a quick list of time codes that will communicate to your students that key concepts will be covered. This is especially helpful for long videos to help with increasing their interest and engagement levels. It is also very helpful for "AdHoc" types of videos (ex: Coaching call replays, Q\&A sessions, Live stream relays)

**Key Benefits:**

* Add clickable "time code" chapters for your Thinkific Course Video lessons
* Personalize your site pages with user name and custom attributes injected anywhere in the page
* Create variations of text that can make your site pages speak to 3 different types of customers
* Set up in minutes, no tech skills required. no developer required. no theme customizations required
