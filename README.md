### Why you should use this super power:

* Your students will be more engaged with your videos because you will be providing a quickly readable summary of what will be covered in the video
* Your students can then quickly jump to a specific spot in the video by clicking on the time code text.
* Perfect for long videos like "coaching call replays"
* Mark off key points of any video lesson so your students can quickly refer back to a point of interest
* Help your students find exactly what they are looking for by referencing significant portions of your videos
