**plaYEAH!** is a Thinkific "App" - or as we like to call it a "PowerUp"ðŸ’ª, because all PowerUps have one goal in mind:  :man\_mage: **make your Thinkific site more powerful.**&#x20;

The course player experience is one of **the most important experiences** that you can have as a course creator. Even if your videos and content is good, your students may still lose interest if their experience is not **pleasurable or memorable.**

plaYEAH! allows you to customize the style of the course player so that it not only feels more like your brand with your **custom colors** :art: and **fonts** :abc: , but you can also disable things like the "progress" meter for courses that do not have "progress" (resource library, webinar replays, etc).&#x20;

One important aspect of **increasing course completion and student satisfaction**, is to keep your students engaged, interested and even entertained while watching your content. Many have great intentions when they sign up for your course, but often need some encouraging or nudging or reminding at certain key points of progress.

## What is included with plaYEAH!?

plaYEAH! includes two main features:

### ****:compass: **** [ **Tour Guide (NEW!)**:](tour-guide/using-the-course-player-tour.md)

The ðŸ§­Tour Guide super power, will guide your first time students on how to make their way around your course. It will be shown automatically when the student is seeing it for the first time, and then it will also be accessible via a link that is added automatically to the course player.

### ****:art: [**Power Style Editor**](power-style-editor/power-style-quick-start-guide/):

The Power Style Editor  allows you to alter the styling of the default Thinkific course player. You can colors, use custom fonts and even hide certain aspects of the course player.

### ****:champagne: [**Power Pops Editor**](power-pops-editor/quick-win-guides/)**:**&#x20;

The :champagne: Power Pops Editor this allows you to create "in course" animated popups and notifications that could be used for a variety of use cases.

* **Celebrate** your students progress with a **confetti blast** :confetti\_ball: triggered after reaching a progress milestone
* Send a **subtle nudge of encouragement** :bell: as they complete specific lessons
* ****:pushpin: **Remind them of important resources** to download or access at key points of their progress.
* **Gameify the experience** :joystick: by presenting an overlay with a call to action that is linked to a "hidden course' that can now be unlocked because they made progress.
* **Reward your members** with a "surprise" download or special opportunity to book a 1-on-1 coaching call with you.
* Chain a series of courses that unlock the next one based on completion and then in the final course, you can :money\_mouth: **upsell them to your signature course of membership program.**
* **Notify** them about events or group calls that may be coming up on the calendar :calendar\_spiral:&#x20;
* Present a :rabbit2: fast action bonus of redeeming a coupon with a vanishing call to action.
