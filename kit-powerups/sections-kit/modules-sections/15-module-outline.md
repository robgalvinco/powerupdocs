### How to use this super power

{% hint style="warning" %}
This super power works a bit differently than others. It requires a minimum of two page sections. The "main" section is **Kit: Modules (15)** there should only be one of these. Additional sections for each module group would be added through individual section: **KIT: Modules (15 detail)**
