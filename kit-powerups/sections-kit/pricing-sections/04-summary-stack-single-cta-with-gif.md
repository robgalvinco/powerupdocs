**EXPERIENCE IT:** [Head over to the demo page](https://powerupkit.thinkific.com/pages/pricing) and see this super power in action
{% endhint %}

### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Pricing Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Sections Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Kit: Pricing (04)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Update the headings settings

* [ ] Open the **headings settings group** and add the text you would like to use.&#x20;
* [ ] Add an item included in the bundle on a line inside the **List settings**. These will automatically alternate between the left and right columns.
* [ ] Update the **icon** that is used if you wish to change it. Be sure to reference the [icon guide ](../../../kit-usage-guides/smart-settings/icons.md)for instructions on how to choose from over 7000 icons.
* [ ] Be sure to update the Price text for both the actual price and the stroke price. _You must enter these manually._

#### 3) Update the button settings

* [ ] Open the **Button settings group** and configure the style, text and link that the button will use.

#### &#x20;4) Update the image

* [ ] We have included a[ free Canva mockup](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEs6i1T5KU/g7ZmiT-AcQvKEkkxA9mOKw/view?utm\_content=DAEs6i1T5KU\&utm\_campaign=designshare\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_source=sharebutton\&mode=preview) for the image that is used for this section. You can use this template or provide an image of you own. Be sure to read our [Using Canva Templates guide](../../../kit-usage-guides/media/canva-templates.md)
* [ ] One of the mockups also allows you to use a GIF over one of the mockups to create some movement and capture your readers attention. Be sure to check out [media guide on using GIF's](../../../kit-usage-guides/media/)

#### 5) Choose the styles you would like to use

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and button setting groups**. Be sure to [check the guide](../../kit-common-sections/base-kit.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.
