**ðŸ”¥PRO TIP:** Consider "anchor pricing" strategies to push your readers to your "preferred plan". The idea behind this is to make it a "no brainer". You may also want to include other benefits beyond just a "price difference'. This could include additional access to content or community. Early release content or discount on additional products.
