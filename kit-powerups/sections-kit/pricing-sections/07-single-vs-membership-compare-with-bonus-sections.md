**EXPERIENCE IT:** [Head over to the demo page](https://powerupkit.thinkific.com/pages/pricing) and see this super power in action
{% endhint %}

### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Pricing Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Sections Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Kit: Pricing (07)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Update the headings settings

* [ ] Open the **Section Heading group** and add the text you would like to use.&#x20;
* [ ] There are optional sections for a "large box" and "3 smaller boxes" where you can point out key aspects of the options _(for example trials, money back guarantees, etc)_&#x20;

#### 3) Update the pricing columns&#x20;

* [ ] For each pricing column (left and right) you can provide text and an image for each option.

#### 4) Choose the styles you would like to use

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and button setting groups**. Be sure to [check the guide](../../kit-common-sections/base-kit.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.

**ðŸ”¥PRO TIP:** Consider "anchor pricing" strategies to push your readers to your "preferred plan". The idea behind this is to make it a "no brainer". You may also want to include other benefits beyond just a "price difference'. This could include additional access to content or community. Early release content or discount on additional products.
