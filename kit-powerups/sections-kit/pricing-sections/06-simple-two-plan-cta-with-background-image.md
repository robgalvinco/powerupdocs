### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Pricing Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Sections Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Kit: Pricing (06)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Update the button settings

* [ ] For each of the two buttons, update the text and the page being used for the button

#### 3) Update the image settings

* [ ] Open the **Image settings group** and upload the image to be used for the background. This image will fill the entire space and be cropped automatically.

#### 4) Choose the styles you would like to use

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and button setting groups**. Be sure to [check the guide](../../kit-common-sections/base-kit.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.
