**EXPERIENCE IT:** [Head over to the demo page](https://powerupkit.thinkific.com/pages/pricing) and see this super power in action
{% endhint %}

### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Pricing Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Sections Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Kit: Pricing (03)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Update the headings settings

* [ ] Open the **headings settings group** and add the text you would like to use.&#x20;
* [ ] Add an item included in the bundle on a line inside the **List settings**. These will automatically alternate between the left and right columns.
* [ ] Update the **icon** that is used if you wish to change it. Be sure to reference the [icon guide ](../../../kit-usage-guides/smart-settings/icons.md)for instructions on how to choose from over 7000 icons.
* [ ] Be sure to update the Price text for both the actual price and the stroke price. _You must enter these manually._

#### 3) Update the button settings

* [ ] Open the **Button settings group** and configure the style, text and link that the button will use.

#### &#x20;4) Update the image

* [ ] We have included a [free Canva mockup](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEs5IoBu-g/lzcReuW1uhmO0RVH81LZ4w/view?utm\_content=DAEs5IoBu-g\&utm\_campaign=designshare\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_source=sharebutton\&mode=preview) for the image that is used for this section. You can use this template or provide an image of you own. Be sure to read our [Using Canva Templates guide](../../../kit-usage-guides/media/canva-templates.md)

#### 5) Choose the styles you would like to use

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and button setting groups**. Be sure to [check the guide](../../kit-common-sections/base-kit.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.

**ðŸ”¥PRO TIP:** The main benefit of this section is for your reader to be reminded of the value  that they are getting. The image mockup we used communicates this by including screenshots or mockups of everything that is included. In the list of items, it is recommended that each item has a "value" listed.
