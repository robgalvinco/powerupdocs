### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Pricing Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Sections Kit** installed into your site

#### 2) Update the headings settings

* [ ] Open the **headings settings group** and add the text you would like to use. There is is text for the heading over the price, the price and the accent text next to the box.

#### 3) Update the button settings

* [ ] Open the **Button settings group** and configure the style, text and link that the button will use.

#### 4) Update the image

* [ ] We have included a [free Canva mockup](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEs6i1T5KU/g7ZmiT-AcQvKEkkxA9mOKw/view?utm\_content=DAEs6i1T5KU\&utm\_campaign=designshare\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_source=sharebutton\&mode=preview) for the image that is used for this section. You can use this template or provide an image of you own. Be sure to read our [Using Canva Templates guide](../../../kit-usage-guides/media/canva-templates.md)
* [ ] One of the mockups also allows you to use a GIF over one of the mockups to create some movement and capture your readers attention. Be sure to check out [media guide on using GIF's](../../../kit-usage-guides/media/)

#### 4) Choose the styles you would like to use

**ðŸ”¥PRO TIP:** This section great to use as an "introducing..." section or at the bottom of your sales page. It quickly communicates value to your reader with the eye catching mockup image and also as a simple large single call to action with accent text pointing to it.
