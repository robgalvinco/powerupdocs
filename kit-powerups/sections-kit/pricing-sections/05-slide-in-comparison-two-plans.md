* [ ] Add the text and page that the button will use for each group

#### 3) Update the button settings

#### 4) Choose the styles you would like to use

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and button setting groups**. Be sure to [check the guide](../../kit-common-sections/base-kit.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.

**ðŸ”¥PRO TIP:** Consider "anchor pricing" strategies to push your readers to your "preferred plan". The idea behind this is to make it a "no brainer". You may also want to include other benefits beyond just a "price difference'. This could include additional access to content or community. Early release content or discount on additional products.
