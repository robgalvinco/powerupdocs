### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Promo Kit Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Promos Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Promo (11)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Update the headings

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and accent**. Be sure to check the [<mark style="color:orange;">Smart Style guide</mark>](../../kit-usage-guides/smart-settings/smart-style.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.

#### 3) Set the location of the section

* [ ] You can use this section as a "sticky bar" - where it will stay in the same position either at the _top_ of the page or the _bottom_ of the page. If you would like to use this section as a normal "inline" section, then choose _Normal Section_

#### 4) Configure your countdown

* [ ] Open the **Countdown Timer settings group** and configure if you want to use the countdown timer. And if so, set the date and time that will be used. Be sure to check the [countdown timer guide](../../kit-usage-guides/popups-timers-and-exit-intents/using-a-countdown-timer.md) for more information on setting the correct time.

#### 5) Update the visibility settings

* [ ] Open the _**Visibility**_ settings group
* [ ] Set the _**Delay to appear**_ slider to the number of seconds that you want to wait until the popup is shown. _It is recommended to have a small delay so that your reader is not caught off guard when the page loads. It is more likely they will pay attention to the popup instead of showing it right away._
* [ ] Set the _**Promo ID**_ if you want to track identify and track this popup across different pages. For example, if you want to only allow this popup to be shown once, but are using it on many pages, be sure they all have the same Promo ID
* [ ] Set the _**Limit times shown**_ slider to be the number of times you would like to show the promo bar.

ðŸ”¥**PRO TIP**: Keep the message short and sweet so it stays on one line and is easier to read. Choose colors that will make the bar "pop" on the page.
