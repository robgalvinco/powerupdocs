### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Promo Kit Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Promos Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Promo (10)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Update the headings

* [ ] Open up the Headings section group and type in your text that you would like to use for the heading and summary. Be sure to [<mark style="color:orange;">check the Smart Style guide</mark>](../../kit-usage-guides/smart-settings/smart-style.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.&#x20;

#### 3) Set the location of the section

* [ ] You can use this section as a "sticky bar" - where it will stay in the same position either at the _top_ of the page or the _bottom_ of the page. If you would like to use this section as a normal "inline" section, then choose _Normal Section_

#### 6) Update the visibility settings

* [ ] Open the _**Visibility**_ settings group
* [ ] Set the _**Delay to appear**_ slider to the number of seconds that you want to wait until the popup is shown. _It is recommended to have a small delay so that your reader is not caught off guard when the page loads. It is more likely they will pay attention to the popup instead of showing it right away._

#### 7) Update the text and styles you would like to use
