### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Promo Kit Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Promos Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Promo (04)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Add the main static image

* [ ] Open the **image settings group** and add your image. This image will cover the space on the left hand side and is permanent. Be sure to check the specified size mentioned in the settings and checkout our [guide on making sure your images are optimized](../../kit-usage-guides/media/image-optimization.md).

#### 3) Update the styles to use

* [ ] Update the styles and colors that will be used for the **text, background and button setting groups**. Be sure to [check the guide](../kit-common-sections/base-kit.md) on how to use named colors, custom fonts and more.

#### 4) Configure your slider behavior

* [ ] Adjust your **slider options** to control if the slider will advance automatically or how long the delay is between the transitions between items

#### 5) Add a block setting for each of your slider items

* [ ] **Add a block for each item** you wish to show on the Deals Slider. Each Item on the slider includes settings for the text being used. Each text field supports [Smart Style](../../kit-usage-guides/smart-settings/smart-style.md) to allow you easily highlight, underline and change the boldness of specific portions of text.&#x20;
* [ ] **Set the type of button** to be used for each slide. You can decide to link to a specific page like a checkout or landing page. Or you could use the included [Funnel Kit Optin ](../kit-common-sections/funnel-kit-opt-in.md)if you would like to open a popup asking for their contact information. There is also a special "Page Pricing Section" option for the button if you want to jump down to a Kit Pricing section block (which required a Kit Pricing section to be included). _Generally it is recommended that the button be linked to the checkout page for your special price._
