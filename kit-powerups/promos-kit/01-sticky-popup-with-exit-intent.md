{% endhint %}

### How to use this super power

#### 1) Add the Promo Kit Sections to the page

* [ ] Make sure you have the **Promos Kit** installed into your site
* [ ] On a site page, add (or copy) the **Base kit Section** that is included with all of our Kit PowerUps. The Base Kit section contains the style choices that will be used on this page for all other Kit sections.&#x20;
* [ ] Add a section and search for **"Promo (01)"** and add it to your page

#### 2) Add your images and text for the sticky popup

* [ ] Set up your **Small Popup Headings** for the text that will appear on the sticky popup. _You can also not include any headings by just removing all text._&#x20;

* [ ] Next, configure your **Button settings** for the text and the page to be used for the button. _There is a button on the small sticky popup and the exit intent. This setting controls both buttons._
* [ ] Upload your **images to be used on the sticky popup**. There is one for the circle (we recommend a picture of yourself) and one for the main image. Here is a [free Canva template ](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEtpUtqcI4/shhzQ58qGL4ieUudxTc6xA/view?utm\_content=DAEtpUtqcI4\&utm\_campaign=designshare\&utm\_medium=link\&utm\_source=sharebutton\&mode=preview)you can use to easily create your own using your images and colors. _Note: removing an image will make the sticky popup be a "text only" message and is perfectly fine to do, but images always grab more attention._

#### 3) Set the visibility settings for the sticky popup

* [ ] Optionally change the **Popup Visibility settings** to set the behavior you want for how soon and how often you want the popup to appear. _We recommend some delay in the popup appearing so that your reader does not immediately want to close it._ [_<mark style="color:orange;">**Check our guide on Popup Visibility settings for more details**</mark>_](../../kit-usage-guides/popups-timers-and-exit-intents/popup-visibility-settings.md)_<mark style="color:orange;">****</mark>_

#### 4) Set up the Exit Intent settings and content

* [ ] Open the **Exit Intent settings and change the settings** to control its behavior. Be sure to read the [<mark style="color:orange;">**Exit Intent guide**</mark>](../../kit-usage-guides/popups-timers-and-exit-intents/exit-intents.md) to understand why and how you should use this super power.

* [ ] Change the **Exit intent headings and image settings.** These can be the same as your had used on the small sticky popup, but it is recommended to make it different so that you have a "second chance" at grabbing the reader's attention.
* [ ] Lastly, you can change the style being used for the headings and background color of the popups.

**ðŸ”¥PRO TIP:** Drop this super power onto your checkout page and promote a coupon to be used during checkout. The exit intent feature of this Promo PowerUp will really kill off your cart abandonments. _Note: The "Streamlined Checkout" is not supported due to not being able to control that via Site Builder._
