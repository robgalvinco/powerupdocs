* [ ] Next, configure your **Button settings** for the text and the page to be used for the button.&#x20;

#### 3) Set the visibility settings for the sticky popup

* [ ] Optionally change the **Popup Visibility settings** to set the behavior you want for how soon and how often you want the popup to appear. _We recommend some delay in the popup appearing so that your reader does not immediately want to close it._ [<mark style="color:orange;">**Check our guide on Popup Visibility settings for more details**</mark>](../../kit-usage-guides/popups-timers-and-exit-intents/popup-visibility-settings.md)<mark style="color:orange;">****</mark>
