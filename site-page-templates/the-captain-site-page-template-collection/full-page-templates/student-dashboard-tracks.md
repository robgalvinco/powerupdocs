{% hint style="info" %}
Category tracks will only show courses that the student is enrolled in. Site Builder does not always represent the actual state of a logged in student. Please be sure to check this page from the actual student dashboard page: yoursite.thinkific.com/enrollments



If a category track contains no elements to display for the currently logged in student, then it will automatically be hidden

### Styles & Colors

We always try to have the style of our page templates blend in instantly with whatever Theme style and color scheme you are using. Each color option indicates where the default color is coming from  the [Thinkific Theme Settings](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033673933). You can also over-ride these settings and select a color combination that works for you.
