# Special Super Powers

## Section Reveals

In each of the Build Your Own sections there is a settings group for Section Reveal settings. When checked, the section will start as hidden and then when the section reveal timer is over, the section will be shown. To be used with another section that contains a section reveal timer. ex: [The Captain Video Funnel](full-page-templates/video-funnel-page.md). This allows you to create a "hidden" sales page or special offer that will be revealed at just the right time.
