# The Collections

Site Page Template Collections have been purposely built to make your live easier in building and maintaining your Thinkific site. Our goal is to reduce the amount of time it takes to create a page by packaging everything you need into one section. If you see a page template that you like, then just snap in that section and then add your text and media. Most of the collections will also come with a catalogue of individual sections that you can use to create your own page

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Site  Page Templates** are different than SNAP Course Page Templates. The templates covered in this section are for the "rest of your site" including custom pages for purpose built templates.&#x20;
