If you **want to walk through the guide in a step by step way**, then head on down below :point\_down: and start checking things off the Quick Win list (virtually, the checkboxes you see are just visual cues for you to know it is a "to-do") _Please do not send any support tickets about "the checkboxes on your docs are not working, I click them and nothing happens.."
