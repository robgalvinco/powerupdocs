* [ ] **Create a new custom page** called _Downloads Styles_ - we will use this one **so we can create a new style** for a group of "not-a-course-courses"
* [ ] _Remove the Banner section and set the page security_
* [ ] **Copy the Power Style Editor** section from the [My Playeah Style page](power-style-quick-start-guide/) we created earlier
* [ ] **Set the **_**Progress**_** setting to **_**Hide**_ inside the _Side Menu (Top Section)_
* [ ] Open the _Style Applies To_ settings group and change the _Applies to_ dropdown to **Specific Courses**
* [ ] _Add a Course Targeting Block_ for each course that you want to apply this style grouping to.
* [ ] **Click the Copy Code** button
* [ ] Hop back into _Site Footer Code_ settings, and **paste it below the default one**

It is recommended to only create a few of these style groupings. Start with the default one that you want to apply to "ALL" of your courses. Then just create style groupings for sets of courses that need a different style.
