* **Type:** controls what type of background the style will use
  * **Default**: Will use the standard player settings
  * **Custom Color:** Will use a solid color from the Color 1 setting
  * **Custom Gradient:**  Will use a gradient (going from color 2 on top down to color 1 on bottom (like you see on the screenshot on this page)
  * &#x20;**Custom Image:** Will use the image you upload as the background
* **Color 1 / Color 2** - Used on Custom color or Custom Gradient as described above.
* **Image:** This will "fill" the background size. It is suggested to pick something subtle so the text is viewable on top of it. 1600x900 is a good size.
