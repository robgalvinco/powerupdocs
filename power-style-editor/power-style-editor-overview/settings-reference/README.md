# Settings Reference

On the left hand side of the Power Style Editor, you will see groups of settings. If you expand the settings groups, you will find a set of settings that applies to that group.

You can decide to only over-ride some of the settings ad keep the default for others. For example in the [Quick Start Guide](../../power-style-quick-start-guide/quick-start-guide.md#your-first-power-style), we only changed the background color.

To over-ride a style for a particular setting, you would change the drop-down for that style to something either than **"Default".**&#x20;

Check the settings reference for the specific settings group for more details on the options.
