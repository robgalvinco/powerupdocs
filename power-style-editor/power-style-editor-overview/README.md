# Power Style Editor Overview

## Overview of using the Power Style Editor

Here is a high level overview of how to use the Power Style Editor section that is included with plaYEAH! PowerUp.

* A custom page will be used to allow you to **preview and save your design** before making it live. _On this page we are simulating what you would see inside the course player_
* You will use the **Power Style Editor section** inside of Site Builder to setup either a default style or course specific styles
* The Power Style Editor will automatically generate a snippet of code that you will copy and paste into Site Footer Code

## Getting to Know the Power Style Editor UI

* **Settings Area**: The settings area to the left are essentially Site Builder setting groups that you should already be familiar with. Except these are specific settings for the Power Style Editor. Each settings group controls specific settings for areas that are on the course player preview section

* **Preview Section:** The player preview section is just a preview. It is not a working course player. The "hamburger" menu does not function nor does the expand and collapse sections for the chapters and lessons. This is intended to simulate what the course player _will look like if you paste the settings into the Site Footer section_ as described below.

Depending on your browser size, you **may not see the "side" bar** that you would normally see (and what is typically styled). **To see the sidebar in preview, be sure to click the full screen icon at the top of the page:**
