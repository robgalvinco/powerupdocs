## How to use this super power:

* [ ] Add your custom fields into your Site Settings
* [ ] On the **Checkout Sign Up** page, add the **Magic Signup Fields** section
* [ ] Inside the Magic Signup Fields settings, add a block for each custom sign up field that you would like to turn into a drop-down or a checkbox
* [ ] Make sure the Label matches the _Custom field name_ you used

### Dropdown Field Types

To change a custom sign up field to be a drop down:

* [ ] Inside of the Magic Sign Up Fields block settings, change the **Type** setting to Drop Down
* [ ] Then add your list of options ([for example a list of states](https://textlists.info/geography/list-of-u-s-states/))

{% hint style="info" %}
The first item on the list will be default. If you would like to force your user to select one, then add a blank line as the first item and also set the field to be required in your Site Settings page
{% endhint %}

### Checkbox Field Types

To change a custom sign up field to be a checkbox, you have two choices

**Type 1: Allow the checkbox to be on or off**

* [ ] Make sure the Label matches the Custom field name you used
* [ ] Inside of the Magic Sign Up Fields block settings, change the Type setting to **Checkbox**

**Type 2: Only allow the user to sign up if they checked the box**

* [ ] Make sure the Label matches the Custom field name you used
* [ ] Inside of the Magic Sign Up Fields block settings, change the Type setting to **Checkbox (Must Acknowledge - Required)**
* [ ] **Be sure the custom sign up field is also set to be required on the Site settings page.**&#x20;

### Understand the difference between "Sign Up" page and the "Checkout Sign in" page

The Magic Sign up fields can be used on both pages, but does require you to place the section on both pages separately.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The magic signup fields does not change the account profile page and add drop downs (due to not being able to control this page from Site Builder. It is recommended that the custom sign up fields be hidden from the account profile page, by adding this snippet of code to your Site Footer Code section
{% endhint %}

## Social Sign Up and Account Pages

If you have the social sign in options turned on for your site  and your custom fields are required, the user will be presented with a "Social Sign Up Page" that will contain the custom fields. Likewise the My Account Profile Page is also not accessible from within Site builder and therefore we need to handle this a bit differently.

* [ ] Once you have completed setting up the Magic Sign up fields on the Sign Up or Checkout Sign Up pages, you will see a popup inside of Site Builder prompting you to paste a code snippet into your Site Footer code
* [ ] Click the button the popup and paste it into the Site Footer Code settings. This will not activate the Magic Sign Up fields on these pages

{% hint style="info" %}
Every time you make a change to your Magic Sign Up fields, you have to repeat the process of pasting the special code to the Site Footer code settings. Be sure to delete what was previously pasted.
{% endhint %}

#### If you also want to hiding the custom sign up fields on the account profile page, add the following to your site footer code as well:

```css
<style> .my-account__form-contents .form__group:nth-child(n+6){ display:none; } </style>
```
