Some people just hate "having yet another account" to deal with and hate even more to login with their Google or Facebook accounts due to security or privacy concerns. So we don't want that to get in the way of having new users buy your course. And for free courses, we most certainly want to have a "frictionless" checkout experience as possible.

### How to use this super power:

* [ ] Be sure you have Swiss PowerUp installed into your site
* [ ] Open up Site Builder and navigate to the Checkout Sign In Page
* [ ] Add a section and search for _**Hide Checkout Password**_ section from the Swiss Power Up
* [ ] That's it. You may want to remind your members in the welcome email how they can change their password by going to the `yourdomain.thinkific.com/account/password` page
