# Redirect (If enrolled in)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-08-25 at 1.39.13 PM.png>)

This section will redirect users to a different page based on their enrollment status on a single course or bundle.

For example, let's say you want to have two different versions of a student dashboard. Maybe you have a membership for your Dog Training and also have a membership for your Cat Training courses.

In this case you would add a _Redirect (if enrolled in)_ section to the student dashboard and configure it to redirect anyone enrolled in the Dog Training Bundle to a custom page for the 'Dog Dashboard".

Then you would add a second _Redirect (if enrolled in)_ section to the student dashboard and configure it to redirect anyone enrolled in the Cat Training Bundle to a custom page for the 'Cat Dashboard".
