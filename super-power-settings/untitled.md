# Ding (Sidebar)

## About this super power:

The Ding (Sidebar) section will allow you to add notification messages for your members. There is a notification button that gets displayed on top of the page and when your member clicks it, a sidebar filled with your notifications appears.&#x20;

### How to use this section:

* [ ] Add the **Ding (Sidebar**) section onto a page (usually the student dashboard, but it can be used on any page)
* [ ] Change the colors and style options you would like to use
* [ ] Add Announcement posts to either be posted right away or to be scheduled to be shown on a certain date.
* [ ] Configure the Announcement post to be show to certain users based on enrollment status

To add announcements, you must add an announcement post in the Blocks portion of the section. Each announcement post has it's own set of settings to control what is shown, how/when it appears and who see's it

#### Announcement Post Settings

* **Image** - upload an image to be used for the announcement. Remove the default sample image if you want a text only announcement post

* **Heading** - this is the title that is shown for the announcement
