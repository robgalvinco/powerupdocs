# Choosing a Color Scheme

By default Sidenav will use your Theme colors that you have set inside of your Thinkific theme, but you can also either choose a preset theme or have complete control over all of the colors used.

## Choosing a theme preset

* [ ] Open up the _**Colors** settings group_ of the Sidenav Menu section and choose a color scheme preset
  * [ ] _**Thinkific**_ : will use the colors you have in your Theme Settings
  * [ ] _**Dark:**_ will use a preset "dark theme" : you can also choose the "primary color" to use
  * [ ] _**Light**:_ will use a preset "light theme" : you can also choose the "primary color" to use
  * [ ] _**Custom:**_ will allow you to specify colors for all of the elements on the page (using the color selectors right below the dropdown)

## Creating a custom color scheme

When you select a _**Custom** option from the Color Scheme dropdown_, the color sectors become active. Configure each color option to change the color for that specific element
