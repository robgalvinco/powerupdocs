# Changing default text

On the Sidenav Menu, you will be setting the specific text for each item on the menu, but there are also autogenerated links for _**My Account portion**_ of the menu. If you would like to change the default text for this menu, whether you want to show your own language or you want to rename the default text, you would change the text found in the _**Headings** section settings._
