  movement while scrolling

{% hint style="warning" %}
The image here is used for an "interesting transition" to the next section of the lesson=. It will be cropped in various sizes based on the size of the browser and if the course player is in full screen mode or in standard mode. You should select an image that does not have any words and don't care where it gets cropped.

* [ ] Hover over the section and click the **`Copy Player Snip`** button

* [ ] Click the < > code button to return to the normal preview

* [ ] Preview the lesson inside the course player

{% hint style="info" %}
The button color is automatically using the same "brand color" you have set for this course. It will be the same color you see for the complete and continue button.
