### How to use a custom sound effect

You can trigger your own custom sound effect by providing a url to an MP3 file. We have provided a convenient method for uploading an MP3 and obtaining the URL to it.

* [ ] Download or produce a short MP3 file that is intended for a sound effect. You can Google many sites to download free sound effects. Here is one that we like: [https://www.101soundboards.com](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/26542-ringtones-and-notification-sounds-soundboard)
* [ ] Use the container in the settings group and select the **`Upload File`** icon in the toolbar (it's the one that looks like a document)
* [ ] Once the file is uploaded, then **right click** on the link and select `Copy Link address`
* [ ] Then paste it into the **`Custom MP3 Url`** setting
* [ ] Be sure to also choose `Custom` in the settings drop down
