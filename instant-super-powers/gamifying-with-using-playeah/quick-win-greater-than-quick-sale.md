  Using the "Pacman" method to change the way you think about selling your
  course

# Super Pac-man

### :zap: Quick Win => Quick Sale :moneybag:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is much better way to sell your course instead of using the standard Thinkific [free preview](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030722473) feature
{% endhint %}

* [ ] **Setup a free (or super low cost) micro course** or live workshop (using Thinkific [Live Lesson features](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044656134)). The goal is to keep it to **"one thing"** - one quick win for your members (and for you as well because you have to do a :poop: **ton less in trying to sell and create it**). I would personally make it just one lesson.
* [ ] Setup a [**Power Pop**](../../power-pops-editor/quick-win-guides/) **to be triggered upon 100% completion** (also let them know that there is a prize if they mark the lesson complete). Use an [Overlay](broken-reference) or [Side Push](broken-reference) pop type that uses a CTA that is the enroll link to the next "quick win".&#x20;
* [ ] **Create a second hidden mini course** and link the **CTA for the Pop you just created to enroll enroll them in this  hidden course** (using a free "next course" is perfect because they will be brought right into the course)
* [ ] Do the same thing and deliver another quick win in this course that is easy to understand, easy to implement
* [ ] **For the second course, setup another Power Pop that is triggered at 100%** - this one has a message that may temp them to join your signature course/membership at a discounted rate. Point out that will only see this message/offer here - once they close it, it's gone.

You can string as many of these as you like - kind of like a game of Pacman. You can have a few freebies in the beginning that leads them to a course or as little as two
