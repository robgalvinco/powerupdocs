# Member FOMO

### :boom: Fast action & time sensitive :alarm\_clock:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Using FOMO is not only great for _selling_ your course, but it can also be used to your advantage to get your _**current members to take action**._ And this one creates a feeding frenzy:shark: of action.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] **Setup a new micro course to be used just for this** (perfect for memberships). Again the goal is something "micro" (which is less than "mini"). One thing. I would say create one chapter that has two lessons.
  1. Lesson 1 - a simple video or even a PDF to read -Enable lesson prerequisite&#x20;
  2. Lesson 2 - a one question quiz lesson type that is set to "must pass". Make it an easy to get it right type of question (maybe even silly)&#x20;
* [ ] Setup a **second chapter that is called "See if you won"**
  1. For this one you can have a basic video, or text that basically tells them to "Complete the course" to see if you have one.
* [ ] Setup a **Power Pop flow for this course with an** [**Overlay**](broken-reference) **or** [**Side Push**](broken-reference) **pop type configured to be shown upon 100% course completion.** Also set it up with a CTA that is linked to your reward (pdf, book some time, join private call, discount)
* [ ] **Announce** to your audience that you are **offer a prize for the first 20 people** who complete the new "course" you just released. Tell them it will go quick and the contest will end in 2 days
* [ ] **After the prize fills up** (you will have to watch this for now) - change the Power Pop so that it says a "sorry" message instead.
