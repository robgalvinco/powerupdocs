* [ ] Setup a bunch of nudge **Power Pop types;** [**"Mini"**](broken-reference) **or** [**"Medium"**](broken-reference) **** size to be triggered frequently (you can always pick certain courses to target or disable them completely)
* [ ] **Pick a "fun" animation** [**like a dancing monkey**](https://lottiefiles.com/search?q=dancing%20monkey\&category=animations):monkey: and use some fun wording that is focused on encouragement _"This alpaca thinks your are doing great!!"_
