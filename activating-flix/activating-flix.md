At this point you should have Flix installed into your Thinkific site. If not head over to the [install guide](../getting-started/installing-flix.md) and make sure it is installed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have a Thinkific site with active members, you will want to set this up in an "unpublished" theme so you can smoothly transition your students into the new experience. Please consult the "[Staging Your New Experience Guide](../support-and-help/staging-before-going-live.md)" first.

### Setup Steps

* [ ] **Step 1: Course Review** - Flix uses categories to quickly create a set of learning tracks on the Flix dashboard
  * [ ] **ACTION:** Place your courses into site categories
* [ ] **Step 2: Create a Product index** - Flix uses a product index to know what tracks to place your courses into. We will also use this product index in the future to create "smart tracks".
  * [ ] **ACTION:** Create a custom page and add the _Product index_ section from Flix. After a few moments it will create a product index snippet. _Copy the product index_ that is shown on the page. You will need it in the next step
* [ ] **Step 3: Setting up the dashboard** - this is where you will change the way your student dashboard looks by adding category tracks.&#x20;
  * [ ] **ACTION**: Add _Dashboard Hide_ section - This will hide the default dashboard.
  * [ ] **ACTION:** Add _Auto Resume or Auto Suggest_ section
  * [ ] **ACTION:** Add a _Category Track_ section and paste the _Product Index_ snippet into the product index setting
* [ ] **Step 4: Add some style -**select a pre-built style like Disney Plus, Netfix, Hulu or setup your own color theme using Light or dark styles.
  * [ ] **ACTION:** Add a Style & Settings section to apply a color scheme
* [ ] **Step 5 (Optional)**: Change the categories that are shown by unchecking the _auto generate_ option and then manually add a category for each category you want shown.
