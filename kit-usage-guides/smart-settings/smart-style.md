# Smart Style

Inside Kit Super Power sections for most text entries, you may see the words <mark style="color:orange;">**"Smart Style"**</mark> show next to the label. This indicates that this field supports special "tags" that will allow you to quickly apply effects using your colors that you have configured inside of [Base Kit](../../kit-powerups/kit-common-sections/base-kit.md)

**PRO TIP:** Use some Smart Style inside of Kit's Social Proof super power sections to call out key words in the testimonial. It can help "stop the scroll" and draw attention to the key benefits and outcomes your course will provide => higher conversions.

### How to use Smart Style

* [ ] In a Smart Style supported text section, locate where you want to _start the smart styling_
* [ ] Insert one of the support Smart Style Start tags (shown below)
* [ ] When you want to _end the smart styling_, simply enter two right brackets ]]
* [ ] For example, let's say within a heading we wanted to apply our "Color 1" to certain words. We would change  Heading: "BLACK FRIDAY SPECIALS" to "BLACK \[C1]FRIDAY]] SPECIALS". This would make the word "FRIDAY" the color we have set as our Color 1.
