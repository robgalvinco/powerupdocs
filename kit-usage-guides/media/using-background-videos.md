# Using Background Videos

In some of Kit's sections like [<mark style="color:orange;">Promo (08)</mark>](../../kit-powerups/promos-kit/08-banner-with-background-video.md) there is an option to include a background video. For these videos, you need to essentially provide a URL to an MP4 Video file.

Thinkific makes it a breeze by utilizing their course "download" lesson.

* [ ] Create a Web Optimized MP4 video file. You should always limit the length of your video to 30-40 seconds at the most, or even better, find a short video that loops seamlessly, so that it seems like a longer video, but could be less than 1MB or 2MB in size, depending on the length. [<mark style="color:orange;">Videoblocks</mark>](https://www.videoblocks.com/) is a great resource for these videos.
* [ ] Create a dummy course inside your Thinkific site
* [ ] Create a download lesson and upload the video file
* [ ] Open the course as a student
* [ ] Right click on the download link and copy it
* [ ] Paste it into the Kit section settings

#### Also create a Thumbnail for the video

When you are using a background video, you should also provide a "poster" image. This image will be used on mobile devices that do note support HTML5 video and also will be shown briefly before the video plays.

* [ ] Play the video in full screen mode on your laptop or desktop
* [ ] Pause the video on frame one
* [ ] Capture the screen
* [ ] Crop this image in Canva so that it is 1920x1280
* [ ] (Alternatively) **** [<mark style="color:orange;">**use this black image**</mark> ](https://import.cdn.thinkific.com/205311/courses/592321/black-211020-165122.jpg)as the "poster" image so that the first frame is always black.
