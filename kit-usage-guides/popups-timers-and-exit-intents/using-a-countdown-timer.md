**The time you enter should be in UTC time (universal Time Clock aka GMT).**

* [ ] Figure out the day and time you will be using as the "expiration" in UTC by going to this [online time convertor](https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter)
* [ ] Select UTC on the convertor
* [ ] Use the UTC time when entering it inside a Kit section
* [ ] Your users will see a countdown to that specific time no matter what timezone they are in
