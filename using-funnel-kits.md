## Special section settings found in many Funnel Kit Sections

Here are some common settings that you will see inside of [Funnel Kit Sections](funnel-kits/fk-01/sections/)

### Call to Action

Choose a type of call to action to use for the section. Each option will include additional settings to configure and change the behavior of the call to action area of the section. This will determine what is placed in the call to action area of the section

#### **Button**

This will enable the _Button Page_ and _Button Text_ settings and a button will be placed in the area

**Custom Embed**: this will place the embed code provided in the _3rd Party Opt-in Form_ setting to be used. Paste your embed code for an 'inline' form in the _3rd Party Opt-in Form_ setting box. Be sure to set the opt-in form to redirect to a page or show a message. All styling on this form is handled by your lead capture platform.

**IMPORTANT:** if your are using the Thinkific Lead Capture option, be sure to add a page in the Page (after submit) setting. When the form is submitted, the page will be redirected to the page specified, for example: a Thank You Page.
{% endhint %}

### FK Page Nav

This settings group inside of [Funnel Kit Section](funnel-kits/fk-01/sections/) works in conjunction with a [Funnel Kit Page Nav](funnel-kits/fk-01/sections/fk-01-page-nav.md) section to add a link to the Page Nav

![](<.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-04-30 at 11.02.59 AM.png>)

* **Add this section?** - this option will enable the section to be linked from the FK Page Nav
* **Is this the main CTA? -** this will cause this section to be linked to button that is on the page nav. Be sure there is only one of these
* **Label** - this is the text that is used in either the link or the button

### Padding

This setting group allows you to inherit the default section padding specified in the Activation & Settings section. If you would like to alter the section padding for this section , uncheck this option and then drag the sliders for both the top and bottom padding settings based on your desired preference. Sometimes you would like sections to blend together by removing padding entirely.

## Using Icon Codes

In various Funnel Kit sections, there are settings for icon codes. These settings are expecting a short code snippet that will be pasted into the setting that will enable the specified icon to be used.
